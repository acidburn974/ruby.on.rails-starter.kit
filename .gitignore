#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/project/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/project/log/*
/project/tmp/*
!/project/log/.keep
!/project/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/project/storage/*
!/project/storage/.keep

/project/public/assets
/project/.byebug_history
